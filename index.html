        <h1><img alt="Displaced Faces of Zamboanga: Life in Transition" src="img/title.png"></h1>
        <p class="lead">Sixteen months after the 'Zamboanga Siege' – a violent clash between a faction of Moro National Liberation Front and the Philippine government forces in September 2013 killed at least 140 and uprooted 120,000 – almost 20,000 people remain in temporary shelters, struggling to make their ends meet.  Assistance for basic needs of the IDPs such as water, protection and education continue while durable solutions are being sought for their long-term housing and livelihood options. <br><br>
		These photos were taken in different evacuation centres and transitional sites for IDPs in Zamboanga between 15 and 27 January 2015.  Despite the prolonged hardships, many of the displaced people work hard to help their family and fellow IDPs in the community, while the local government and humanitarian organizations provide framework for better assessing their priority needs and deliver tangible support.

			<p>“We are here from the Department of Education (DepEd) to screen children – we want to know the exact numbers of those attending school, those not attending school, and those dropped out. Sometimes parents are too embarrassed to say their kids are out of school, or the kids are working.  So we have to go door to door, so that we can assess the real needs and concerns for education and help effectively.” According to the DepEd, part of the problem has been conflicting numbers provided by different sources. Two temporary learning spaces recently opened for a growing number of children in Masepla. Findings from this screening will help determine if additional alternative learning space will be needed for IDP children across transitional sites. [Masepla-1]</p>

			“What do you do as peacekeepers?” 
			“We patrol the camp, say about 6 times a day, or as needed. Issues we address are mostly litigations between families. Because we’re part of the IDP community, it’s easier for us to understand and talk to them.” “How does being a peacekeeper make you feel?”                                         
			“Being a peacekeeper in the transitional site is a rewarding opportunity for me as an IDP. The challenges I face everyday are the driving force for me to help maintain peace and order here.” 
			Peacekeepers in the evacuation centres and transitional sites are part of the cash-for-work programme of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

			<p>“We organize psychosocial activities for IDP women and children as well as capacity-building programme for IDP women. Every day, we get groups of little kids together to play. We are also engaging men in some of our activities. After the siege, people were busy rebuilding their own lives and often neglected women and children, who are the most vulnerable group. This women- and children-friendly space provides a neutral venue to hear concerns of these women and children and discuss what we can do to address them.” [At the women- and children-friendly spaces built between Masepla-1 and Masepla-2]</p>

My salary as a carpenter allows me to support my family, although it is not enough to send our children to school. My wife and our youngest daughter live here with me, but four of our school-age children are still in Grandstand with relatives during the week because it’s closer to their school. We can’t afford the transportation cost of their commute to the school from here. The siege and its aftermath separated us - I wonder how they’re doing now, if they’re eating alright. But my wife and I want to see them finish their schooling. How I wish every day is Saturday because it is only weekends that my family is complete.” [Masepla-2]</p>

If you take good care of them, these boats will last for many years.” “How long does it take to finish one?” “About four days.” “Where are you from?” “I am from Rio Hondo, but was told I wouldn’t be able to go back there.” [Taluksangay TS]</p>
